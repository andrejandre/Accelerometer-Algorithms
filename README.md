We ran tests with our newtonian setup on an even surface at 0 degrees offset. A mass of 70g was attached to the cart to ensure a theoretical force of 0.5g to be generated. We ran 2 tests in -X, 2 tests in -Y, and 1 test in +X. A test in -X, and in -Y failed due to erroneous communication between the device and iPhone. Tests were ran at 800Hz +- 4Gs. Additionally, our test in the +X directin was sliced and we focused on the window of data where the cart accelerated (so we deleted the portion of data after the crash) to observe any changes on accurac in 3D trajectories. In the velocity plots it is possible to see a moment of constant acceleration as the slope of the velocity curves suggest there may be a constant gravitational force.
