# MetaMotionR-Algorithms

Jan 29 2019:
We ran tests with our newtonian setup on an even surface at 0 degrees offset. A mass of 70g was attached to the cart to ensure a theoretical force of 0.5g to be generated. We ran 2 tests in -X, 2 tests in -Y, and 1 test in +X. A test in -X, and in -Y failed due to erroneous communication between the device and iPhone. Tests were ran at 800Hz +- 4Gs.
